**Main Programming Language: Python3**

**Catalogue:**

1. [Algorithm_Practice](./Algorithm_Practice.py)
    
    I make algorithm practice on [LintCode](https://www.lintcode.com), and this file is the exercises code. 
    I put the execution time complexity data after problem sets, and if I have troulbe with some sets, I'll compare my code with others and put theirs after mine.
2. [Algorithm Knowledge](./Algorithm.md)

    This file is mainly about the Algorithm and Data structure note.
