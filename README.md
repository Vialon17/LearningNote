# Learning Note

_The learning note about programming written by Vialon17_

_Now the version you are looking at is the latest, we'll change some opinion with something with the improvement of our konwledge._

I will note my learning notes here in order to help someone else and create a cloud `Good Luck Charlie`[^1] record.

__Learning Route(2022,February,23):__

There I want to be an AI Engineer at first, but I decide to be a Algorithm Engineer after learning a little about the current station of the Computer Science in view of the deep preference of philosophy. So I'm making a plan to improve the learning efficiency.

_The purpose of a plan should be to make the future better rather than do things inflexibly, I privately think._

I prefer construing the Algorithm as an abstract access to resolve some similar problems or the solving problems logic. After consulting a blog of [Jack Cui](https://cuijiahua.com), I made my learning route:

* __Mathematic__
    
    It's the basic part that u should learn some mathematic logic to understand the world, so just be a master in advanced mathematics, and [Linear Algebra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVKj3LADCnA&list=PL49CF3715CB9EF31D), [probability theory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1uW3qMFA9Ho&list=PLUl4u3cNGP60hI9ATjSFgLZpbNJ7myAg6) are also necessary for deep learning and algorithm.

    _I plan to use half of year to learn and review those courses._

* __Programming Language__

    There should have two languages u should master: __Python, C++.__ consider that I have learned C++ in the first year of collage and studied Python by myself after leaving school, I should spend some time on them to master the two languages and enhance my comprehension with the programming language so that maybe [Fluent Python](https://github.com/silenove/python_ebook/blob/master/%E6%B5%81%E7%95%85%E7%9A%84python.pdf) and [C++ Primer Plus](https://shenjun4cplusplus.github.io/cplusplushtml/) are good friends in study.

    _I plan to spend one year to finish these two books._

* __Algorithm and Data Structure__

    Then it's the time to get touch with the basic algorithm and master data structure with python or C++. In fact, I have learned some knowledge of them as I write this article, so maybe this section is the easist part in my algorithm leaning road. There u should finish these books: [Grokking Algorithms](https://github.com/bat67/awesome-algorithm-books/blob/master/classic%20algorithms/%E7%AE%97%E6%B3%95%E5%9B%BE%E8%A7%A3%20-%202017.pdf), [å‰‘æŒ‡Offer - Python Edition](https://github.com/JushuangQiao/Python-Offer), [Algorithm 4Edi](https://github.com/hongye612430/awesome-programming-books-1/blob/master/algorithms/%E7%AE%97%E6%B3%95%EF%BC%88%E7%AC%AC4%E7%89%88%EF%BC%89.pdf).

    I had finished the basic part several days ago and also did some algorithm practice on [LintCode](https://www.lintcode.com), but it's obvious that more exercises and competitions are necessary for my study.

    So it's time to get through the tough day and the [Algorithms 4th Edition](https://hk1lib.org/book/2738376/3dc280)! making deep comprehension with Data Structure seems also important.

    _It seems a long way if I wanna be an algorithm master, so I'll do some algorithm practice everyday to enhance the comprehension with algorithm logic._

* __Machine/Deep learning__
  
    The core part, no matter for the algorithm engineer or AI engineer.

    [Machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning) is mainly about some learning computer algorithm those can predict and process new data after having been trainned with some data. It's the combination of Computer Science, Statistics and Data Science, and divide with the used software algorithm, ML perfrom pretty good when processing fuzzy data.

    In recent years, with the flash of deep learning, which is an important branch of Mearning learning, ML comes back to prople's view once again after it had been forgotten for about 30 years.

    Now I'm learning ML on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), known as the biggest data model and machine learning online platform in the world. 
    ~~It's wonderful and I like it so much!~~


## [Algorithm and Data Structure](./Algorithm/Algorithm.md)

The algorithm and data structure is a basic part of programming learning. 

I prefer regarding Algorithm as the important core part with the data structure as the basic.

Here is where I truely start my programming study. *It's is chaotic,but I'll fix it in my free time.*

## [MySQL](./MySQL/MySQL.md)

I have to learn MySQL for my job, but I'd prefer the non-relational database MongoDB for its Popularity in recent years. 

There the SQL is the basic for data analysis so there could havn't any reasons for me don't master it.

Let's make it. ðŸ˜€

## [Python](./Python/ReadMe.md)

I have learned Python by myself intermittently in last year, but it's necessary for me to improve the comprehension with Python. Once having a try, u'll found the [Fluent Python](https://au1lib.org/book/17194890/bf297b) is a twinking star that can light up ur way to ~~brickyard~~ ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£.

But if u don't have any programming experience, u'd better make youself familiar with the basic Python syntax and basic computer science knowledge though Python seems like the easiest programming language to learn. The [Runood](https://www.runoob.com/python3/python3-tutorial.html) and [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp) maybe good choices for beginner, and [Offical Docs](https://docs.python.org/zh-cn/3.9/) will offer the long-term support for ur study.
