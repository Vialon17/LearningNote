# LearningNote

_The learning note about programming written by vialon17_

I will note my learning notes here in order to help someone else and create a cloud `Good Luck Charlie`[^1] record.

## [Algorithm and Data Structure](./Algorithm/Algorithm.md)

The algorithm and data structure is a basic part of programming learning. 

I prefer regarding Algorithm as the important core part with the data structure as the basic.

Here is where I truely start my programming study. *It's is chaotic,but I'll fix it in my free time.*

## [MySQL](MySQL.md)

I have to learn MySQL for my job, but I'd prefer the non-relational database MongoDB for its Popularity in recent years. 

There the SQL is the basic for data analysis so there could havn't any reasons for me don't master it.

Let's make it. ðŸ˜€
